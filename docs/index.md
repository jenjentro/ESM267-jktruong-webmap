Nation-wide fire suppression was enacted in the early 20th century (Safford & Stevens, 2017). These suppression policies have led to altered fire regimes, changes in forest composition and structure, and an increase in ladder fuels (Miller et al., 2009; Miller & Safford, 2017; Nigro & Molinari, 2019). Increased fuels in fire-suppressed areas are likely to lead to more severe fires and potentially result in the loss of unique and critical ecosystems (citation?). Additionally, climate change is expected to increase mean average temperature, increase the frequency of extreme temperature events, and reduce average precipitation (Hayhoe et al., 2004). These combined factors that contribute to fire severity threaten public safety, infrastructure, and watershed health (Savage & Mast, 2005; Moody et al., 2013; Calkin et al., 2014).

Yellow Pine Mixed Conifer (YPMC) forests are especially susceptible to being lost to high severity wildfires because they are geographically isolated sky islands and consist of trees with non-seritonous cones (Minnich & Everett, 2001). These forests provide critical habitat for wildlife like the California Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis), and continue to provide invaluable ecosystem services such as clean air, water, and carbon sequestration (Schimel & Braswell, 2005; Gonzalez et al., 2015; Hillberg et al., 2016). YPMC forests face many risks, and land managers need to understand best methods to conserve them.
